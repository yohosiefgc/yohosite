        2022 marks my 10th year of being a professionally employed designer. To mark the occasion, a new website was in order. Not only was this an excuse to blow up my old site – an emotionally freeing task – but it was also an excuse to show off. A way to showcase my decades worth of knowledge, and test and stretch what I've done as a creator.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve never been a believer in using common website tools like Squarespace, Behance, Wix, or WordPress for a portfolio. It’s fine in production, but if you know how to code, you should build your own website. Given most of my work involves other people’s content – as I have been employed as a Content Producer for the past 4 years – it also gives me an excuse to show off a bit and make the container surrounding my work the primary portfolio piece. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My old website was fine when I built it. It was built in 2017 after leaving a job I didn’t enjoy, and before my journey from Orlando, Florida to San Francisco (<i>I am now located in Seattle</i>). At the time I liked my brand – I still kind of do – but it isn’t who I am now, and it reads slightly amateurish to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I knew when I started designing this website, I would need a new brand. Guided by new design principles of logos being just your name, a trend which was not the case when I first started professional, I experimented with typefaces and quickly landed on Acumin Variable Concept. I was struck by the Text Strokes variation, which was designed to be overlaid on top of the type in its normal variation as a textural element. It was interesting, and techy, and the type begged me to remove it from its context, and use it in interesting ways. What if it was cropped off the page? What if it was separated from the text that made it readable? What if it was a textural element?
        <br>
        <br>
        Historically I have been a very structured designer. I would spend 10, 20, 30 hours forging something that I believed was perfect. Carefully constrained, aligned with the grid, carefully crafted, but ultimately lacking a distinct personality. The taking of what Acumin Variable Concept was built to do and flipping it on its head – pulling it out of its designated place and using it in interesting ways – embodied my new design style of escaping from the grid. Escaping from my boring past. It wasn’t readable, but there's that famous quote from David Carson: “Don't mistake legibility for communication”. It was fun, and interesting. And playables are fun and interesting. And my work is fun and interesting.
        <br>
        <br>
        After I settled on a typeface and a font style, the design of the site came together immediately, and the layout was solved almost instantaneously. With my history as a Print Designer and my current work as an interactive designer, I wanted to build a website that fused my past and present. I decided early on a horizontal layout, with unusual margins and page layouts, and a desktop-first instead of a mobile-first design. Conceptually, you’re here because you’re a professional interested in what I do. I imagine you’re on your computer, not your phone.
        <br>
        <br>
        I design primarily in Illustrator, using Photoshop and Premiere as support. <i>(I have never enjoyed Figma, Sketch, or other similar programs. I have a specific memory of an intern laughing when I said I design websites in Illustrator – my first experience in being “seasoned” in the industry.)</i> The layouts flowed from me, and all pages, supporting files, everything came to fruition quickly. Blog pages, Portfolio Layouts, Homepages, etc. Designing for myself is easy for me. Coding is a bit more challenging.
